Term Paper
----------

The term paper counts as 40% of the course grade. It should contain a short introduction presenting an overview of the topic, a main part developing and discussing the key ideas, and a conclusion. It is due during the last lecture, in class.

Topics Suggestions for Term Paper References
--------------------------------------------

Suggested topics numbered by 1), 2) etc. are grouped into categories corresponding to different parts of the course. The papers are selected according to a combination of the novelty and readability criteria applied quite freely. I tried to keep in the list only the papers which one can enjoy reading.
