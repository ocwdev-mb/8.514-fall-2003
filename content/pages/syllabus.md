Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Aim of the Course
-----------------

The aim of the course is two-fold. First, we shall discuss topics of interest for both condensed matter and atomic physics, focussing on the effects of quantum statistics, interactions, and correlations in many-particle systems. Our second goal will be to provide a gentle introduction to the methods of quantized fields and their applications in many-body physics. We shall try to emphasize the physical and visualizable aspects of the subject. While the course is intended for students with a wide range of interests, many examples will be drawn from condensed matter physics.

Prerequisites
-------------

Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics, introductory level courses, such as [8.044](/courses/8-044-statistical-physics-i-spring-2013) (Statistical Physics I), [8.08](/courses/8-08-statistical-physics-ii-spring-2005) (Statistical Physics II), and [8.04](/courses/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2013) (Quantum Physics I).
